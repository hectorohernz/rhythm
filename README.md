# rhythm
Rhythm is a collection of two dimensional animations that are triggered by tapping on the color pads. This small project was inspired by Patatap.com. 

# How To Get Started
Open The Website and begin tapping on any of the color pads, while tapping on a pad a sound will be triggered with a two dimensional bubble.
